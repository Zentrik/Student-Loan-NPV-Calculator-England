# Student Loan NPV Calculator - England
Calculates NPV of English student loan repayments using CPIH. Specifically this is for a loan taken out in 2021.
This is inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/badeconomics/comments/k9g348/what_vanguard_wont_tell_you/

To run create a file `config.py` in root directory with contents (you need to generate your own API keys):
```
alphaKey = 'REPLACEME'
fredKey  = 'PLACEHOLDER'
```
